# esm-patient-notes-shadow-app

This project provides custom implementations of patient visit note features where our requirements differ from the OpenMRS community implementations.  
For example, it extends the Visit Note form workspace to  support for selecting diagnostic certainty.

These custom components are intended as temporary overrides. Once the required features are available in the community MFEs, they will be removed and the system will revert to using the standard implementations only.
